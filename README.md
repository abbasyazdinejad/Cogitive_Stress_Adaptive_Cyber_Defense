# Cognitive Stress–Adaptive Cyber Defense

This repository contains the research code and demonstration materials for the paper:

**Towards Stress-Adaptive Cyber Defense: Cognitive–Physiological Synchronization in IoT Environments**

The project investigates how physiological stress inference and cognitive decision modeling can be integrated into cyber-physical and Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows to enable **stress-aware, adaptive cyber defense strategies**.

## Project Overview

Modern cyber-physical and IoT environments increasingly rely on human analysts operating under high cognitive load. This project explores a **stress-adaptive cyber defense framework** that:

- infers operator stress from multimodal physiological signals,
- models cognitive decision-making under stress,
- adapts SOC response strategies accordingly,
- evaluates system behavior under controlled simulation conditions.

The framework integrates:
- physiological signal processing,
- machine-learning–based stress classification,
- cognitive agents (e.g., SpeedyIBL-inspired reasoning),
- simulated SOC environments driven by synthetic and benchmark attack traces.
